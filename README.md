# cpp-shopping-app
 This project is a console-based shopping and company information system developed using fundamental C++ structures. The program provides an interactive menu to the user by processing product and employee data defined using struct structures. Users can review products, add them to the cart, view the total amount, and complete the transaction with installment payment options. Additionally, detailed information about company employees can be listed. Within the scope of the project, core C++ programming concepts such as decision structures (switch-case), loops, arrays, input/output operations, and the use of locale are effectively applied. The application serves as an instructive example for beginner-level developers to practice menu-based application development and data processing.
